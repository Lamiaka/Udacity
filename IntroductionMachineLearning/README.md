This is a folder gathering my work on the Udacity **Machine Learning - Introduction Nanodegree Program**.   The Nanodegree program splits in 3 sections below: 

1. [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/Lamiaka/Udacity/tree/master/IntroductionMachineLearning/Supervised%20Learning)  
The [project](https://github.com/Lamiaka/Udacity/tree/master/IntroductionMachineLearning/Supervised%20Learning/9-Project-FindingCharityDonors) in this section consisted of predicting donors for a charity using a supervised machine learning algorithm.
2. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/Lamiaka/Udacity/tree/master/IntroductionMachineLearning/Deep%20Learning)
3. Unsupervised Learning
